## Working On

FavGrove Rebrand And Release Readiness

## Current Goal

Complete the FavGrove `0.2.0` beta migration and close the remaining release gaps before store publication.

## Current Status

- P0 Foundation is complete and verified.
- Dashboard statistics are implemented.
- Search history is persisted locally and capped to the latest 10 terms.
- Recent Activity records bookmark loading, search, and delete actions.
- Scanner worker currently handles:
  - Duplicate bookmark detection by exact URL.
  - Duplicate folder detection by parent/title grouping.
  - Empty folder detection.
  - Progress updates for the existing scan phases.
  - 24-hour scan cache via `scanService`.
- Broken Link Checker is connected through `scanService` and `linkChecker.worker.ts`.
- Link-check scheduling remains in the Web Worker, while privileged HTTPS requests are bridged through the background service worker to avoid options-page CORS errors.
- Plain HTTP links are not fetched automatically and are classified for manual verification to avoid insecure-origin response-header errors.
- Chrome Web Store and Edge Add-ons links are skipped before fetch and classified for manual verification because browser-protected store pages reject automated extension requests.
- Broken link scanning uses:
  - Optional host permission request.
  - Timeout handling.
  - Retry handling.
  - HEAD request with GET fallback.
  - Concurrency control capped at 12.
  - Progress updates from the link-checking stage.
  - GET verification for every failed HEAD request.
  - Protected, rate-limited, and Cloudflare/WAF challenge responses are not counted as confirmed broken links.
- Scanner UI now displays invalid link results.
- Manager currently supports:
  - Folder filtering.
  - Virtualized bookmark rendering.
  - Batch delete with backup creation.
  - Bookmark rename.
  - Folder rename.
  - Bookmark move.
  - Folder move.
  - Drag/drop move to folder.
  - Drag/drop bookmark ordering before a target row.
  - Undo delete.
  - Local tags.
  - Tag filtering.
  - Duplicate folder merge from Scanner results.
  - Backup-before-merge.
- Scanner duplicate-bookmark results can keep the oldest item and remove the remaining copies through the existing backup and undo flow.
- Scanner repair actions rerun structural detection and update the persisted scan cache, so resolved duplicate folders and bookmarks do not return after refresh.
- Link scanning deduplicates exact URLs, preserves per-bookmark results, interleaves hostnames, and limits each hostname to two concurrent requests.
- Default global link-check concurrency is eight for new settings, while cached scan loading now honors the persisted cache duration.
- Link scan results now separate confirmed broken links from links that could not be verified because of timeout, server, network, proxy, DNS, TLS, or regional access conditions.
- `/scanner/links` provides filtering, 50-row pagination, manual open-and-check, and backup-protected batch deletion.
- Link issue rows provide separate open, edit URL, and confirmed delete actions.
- The product brand is now `FavGrove - Bookmark Manager` / `FavGrove 书签管理器` for the `0.2.0` beta candidate; the published `0.1.0` Markora release remains historical.
- Import/Export currently supports:
  - JSON, CSV, TXT, OPML, and HTML export.
  - Worker-based Netscape HTML import parsing.
  - Import preview.
  - URL conflict detection.
  - Conflict resolver for skipping existing URLs or importing all.
  - Backup-before-import.
  - Nested folder recreation from Netscape bookmark paths.
- Settings persistence is implemented for:
  - Theme.
  - Language.
  - Scanner timeout, concurrency, and retry count.
  - Scan cache duration.
  - Backup retention.
- Settings backup management supports listing backups, restoring a backup, and deleting backups.
- Restore creates a safety backup before applying a selected backup snapshot.
- App now applies persisted theme and language on startup.
- Playwright E2E smoke tests pass for route navigation, import/settings visibility, and manager controls.
- Expanded E2E covers scanner execution, HTML import preview/conflict handling, and manager rename/tag/move/delete/undo flows.
- HTML import parsing is Worker-safe and no longer depends on `DOMParser`.
- `npm run test:e2e` uses `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` to start and stop Vite cleanly on Windows.
- `PRIVACY.md` documents local data handling, permissions, and the absence of analytics, telemetry, and remote bookmark uploads.
- `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` records the quality, manifest, privacy, manual, store, and artifact release gates.
- `npm run package:release` validates the built manifest and creates a versioned extension ZIP.
- Release packaging produced `release/markora-v0.1.0.zip`, and its contents were inspected successfully.
- Fixed an extension reload failure caused by the E2E Vite server writing CRXJS development output into `dist/`.
- Vite serve output now uses `.crx-dev`, while production builds exclusively use `dist/`.
- `npm run validate:extension` rejects development URLs, broad resource exposure, and missing background service workers.
- Multi-format import requirements are now recorded for JSON, CSV, TXT, and OPML.
- Localization audit found 15 English locale keys missing from Chinese and additional hardcoded user-facing English strings.
- `VERSIONING.md` defines `0.2.0` as the FavGrove beta candidate, preserves `0.1.0` as the historical Markora beta, and reserves `1.0.0` for the first stable store release.
- Locale key parity was improved for `en` and `zh_CN`, and multiple Manager/Scanner/Settings hardcoded UI strings were switched to i18n keys.
- `bookmarkStore` activity log messages and URL validation error text were migrated to i18n keys.
- Service-layer fallback error messages in storage/import/bookmark/scan/link-request services were migrated to i18n keys.
- Related unit tests were updated to assert i18n-derived messages instead of hardcoded English strings.
- Import/Export page fallback `defaultValue` strings were removed in favor of direct locale keys, and Settings language option labels were localized.
- `AGENTS.md` was rewritten as the primary Codex handoff guide with project snapshot, architecture rules, workflow, verification, release rules, data safety, and performance expectations.
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` was rewritten as a stable Codex/human development guide with source layout, layer responsibilities, testing strategy, and current development direction.
- Shared `ConfirmDialog` and `PromptDialog` components were added on top of the existing `Dialog` primitive.
- Dashboard statistic cards now use skeleton placeholders while bookmark data is loading.
- Manager uses `useContainerHeight` for the virtualized list viewport instead of a fixed `620px` height.
- Manager loading now renders skeleton rows matching the virtual row layout.
- Manager bookmark rename, folder rename, tag editing, bulk delete confirmation, and bulk move confirmation now use custom dialogs instead of native browser prompts.
- Link issue URL editing, single deletion, and selected batch deletion now use custom dialogs instead of native browser prompts/confirms.
- Settings backup restore now requires a custom confirmation dialog before calling `restoreBackup`.
- Scanner now has backup-protected batch actions for deleting all detected empty folders and cleaning all duplicate bookmark groups by keeping the oldest entry.
- Scanner repair actions for the new batch buttons reuse `runRepair`, refresh structure results, and save the updated scan cache.
- Playwright E2E was updated to interact with in-app dialogs instead of browser-native dialogs.
- Manager now supports select-all for visible bookmarks, session-only sort options, keyboard shortcuts for select/delete/clear, a shortcut tooltip, and tag counts in the tag filter.
- `sortBookmarks` was added as a shared pure utility with unit coverage for title/date/URL sorting and undefined field handling.
- `scanStore` now tracks the last scan timestamp, and `scanService.getCache` exposes scan-cache metadata for UI use.
- Dashboard now shows a localized "Last scanned" link backed by scan-cache metadata.
- E2E smoke coverage now checks Dashboard last-scan visibility and Manager select-all/sort/shortcut controls.
- Legacy planning files were removed from the workspace; active handoff now lives in `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`, `SESSION.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `TASKS.md`.
- Automatic daily scan is implemented with persisted `autoScan` settings, Manifest V3 `alarms` permission, background alarm registration, a Settings toggle, and a shared structural-scan utility reused by the scanner worker and background alarm.
- Auto-scan saves duplicate bookmark, duplicate folder, and empty-folder scan results to the existing scan cache. Broken-link checks remain manual.
- `PRIVACY.md` documents the new `alarms` permission.
- Backup creation now honors the persisted backup retention setting, and lowering retention trims excess backups safely.
- JSON, CSV, TXT, OPML, and HTML imports now share the existing preview, conflict resolver, and backup-before-import flow through a Worker parser.
- English and Chinese locale key parity is enforced by a unit test; English route smoke coverage remains green.
- Manager now supports batch tag add/remove for selected bookmarks and expand/collapse controls for nested folders.
- Dashboard now includes quick actions, local scan-result recommendations, and pinyin/full-initial search support through the shared bookmark search utility.
- Chinese primary route smoke coverage was added to Playwright and passes after switching the app language in Settings.
- Scanner now supports deleting one detected empty folder with confirmation, backup creation, structure refresh, and scan-cache refresh.
- 10,000-bookmark structural scan and pinyin search benchmarks are covered by `npm run benchmark:performance`.
- Store listing copy, promotional SVG sources, and 1280x800 page screenshots now live under `store/`.
- `npm run check:browsers` verifies Chrome and Edge can load the production `dist/` extension in headless mode.
- Manifest required permissions are now limited to `alarms`, `bookmarks`, and `storage`; the unused `tabs` permission was removed after a source audit found no `chrome.tabs` usage.
- `npm run audit:permissions` verifies the manifest permission boundary and `PRIVACY.md` permission copy.
- Visible browser click-through steps are prepared in `docs/release/browser-clickthrough.md`; the final human-visible Chrome and Edge results still need to be recorded before store submission.
- Full destructive replacement restore is deferred by `docs/decisions/restore-strategy.md`; current restore remains backup-protected and service-boundary scoped.
- GitHub pre-release metadata, store submission fields, and post-beta AI guardrails are prepared in `docs/release/github-prerelease-v0.2.0.md`, `store/submission-fields.md`, and `docs/roadmap/post-beta-ai.md`.
- Link checking now treats ambiguous 4xx responses, including 404, authentication, proxy, and rate-limit responses, as requiring manual verification; only HTTP 410 is automatically classified as confirmed broken.
- Legacy cached 404 results are reclassified under the conservative policy, and link issue rows can be dismissed with "Works for me" / "确认可打开" without changing the bookmark.
- Manually dismissed link URLs are now persisted locally and filtered from future scans and cached results.
- Settings now manages ignored link-check URLs with local search, per-URL re-enable, and confirmation-protected clear-all actions.
- Link issue rows now support an in-place single-link recheck using the current scanner settings; successful checks remove the issue, while failures refresh its status and classification without adding an ignore rule.
- The first post-beta AI milestone is now specified as optional, read-only bookmark-library analysis in `TASK-705` and `.codex/tasks/ai-analysis-integration-2026-07-15.md`. No provider, model, credential, endpoint, permission, or data transfer was added during planning.
- Store-installed updates now use the Chrome/Edge-managed `runtime.onUpdateAvailable` lifecycle. FavGrove persists only the pending version and detection time, shows a localized global notice, and reloads only after the user chooses to apply the downloaded update. No remote version polling or new permission was added.

## Next Step

Run and record the final visible Chrome and Edge click-through checks from `dist/`, then copy the prepared submission fields into the Chrome Web Store and Edge Add-ons portals when publication is approved.

## After E2E

1. Run the visible Chrome and Edge checklist in `docs/release/browser-clickthrough.md`.
2. Confirm the public privacy policy URL and support URL in the store portals.
3. Create the GitHub beta pre-release from `docs/release/github-prerelease-v0.2.0.md`.
4. Upload the verified release ZIP only after the visible browser pass is recorded.
5. After release gates close, implement the provider/data-boundary decision and local preprocessing phase for `TASK-705`.

- On 2026-07-15, the GitHub repository was renamed to `everett7623/FavGrove`; the local `origin`, README, privacy/support links, store metadata, and `v0.2.0` pre-release notes now use the new URL.
- On 2026-07-15, project author attribution was normalized to `everettlabs` across the MIT license, README, npm package metadata, and repository-local Git configuration. The extension manifest author field is intentionally omitted because the CRXJS Manifest V3 contract accepts an email object, not a display name.
- On 2026-07-15, the complete local repository was moved to `D:\EvenFrank\Workspace\Plugins\Google\FavGrove`; Git object integrity, branch tracking, remote configuration, and working-tree changes were verified after the move.
- On 2026-07-15, the FavGrove `0.2.0` development line and future releases were relicensed under `GPL-3.0-or-later`. Production builds and release archives now include the matching license text; previously granted MIT rights, historical release assets, and third-party dependency licenses were not rewritten.
- On 2026-07-16, the browser-managed extension update notice passed ESLint with 0 warnings, TypeScript strict checking, 19 Vitest files with 74 tests, production extension build validation and permission audit, Chrome/Edge headless load checks, and 8 Playwright E2E tests. The required permission set remains `alarms`, `bookmarks`, and `storage`.

## Notes

- Do not reuse stale environment assumptions. The Windows 11 environment has been verified with Git, Node.js v24.16.0, npm v11.13.0, build, lint, and test passing.
- Do not automatically push.
- Update both `SESSION.md` and `PROGRESS.md` after completing each development phase.
- Current restore flow re-applies the selected backup snapshot and creates a safety backup first; destructive full replacement is deferred by `docs/decisions/restore-strategy.md`.
- Use `npm run test:e2e` for Playwright; direct `playwright test` can leave the local web server hanging on this Windows setup.

## Design Notes / Pending Decisions

- Backup restore currently re-applies a selected snapshot and creates a safety backup first.
- Full destructive replacement restore is intentionally deferred to post-beta work.
- HTML import now recreates nested folders; folder conflict behavior currently creates/imports new folders for the import batch.
- Folder merge keeps the first duplicate folder as the target, moves all source children, preserves URL conflicts, and creates a backup first.
- Advanced drag/drop ordering now supports bookmark ordering before a target row; folder ordering polish can be added after E2E coverage.
- Core feature audit added to `TASKS.md`: a saved setting is not considered complete until its service behavior uses it.
- Manual unpacked-extension testing must load `dist/`; `.crx-dev/manifest.json` is development-only and may reference the local Vite server.
- The current release artifact is a local build output and is intentionally ignored by Git.
