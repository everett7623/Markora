# Changelog

All notable changes to FavGrove, formerly Markora, are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added optional, read-only AI bookmark-library analysis with user-provided Chat Completions endpoints, explicit request preview, privacy modes, cancellation, and structured evidence validation.
- Added a localized in-app notice when Chrome or Edge has downloaded a newer store version, with an explicit action to reload FavGrove and apply it.

### Changed

- Export now serializes only the selected format in a Web Worker, with immediate busy feedback instead of generating all five formats on the options-page main thread.
- Replaced destructive backup restore with additive missing-bookmark recovery, parent-ID/path mapping, safety backups, and rollback of failed restore writes.
- Update notices now appear without reopening FavGrove when Chrome or Edge downloads an update while the page is open, and stale update records are cleared locally.
- Localized the route-loading fallback and beta status badge in English and Chinese.
- Renamed the product from `Markora - Bookmark Atlas` to `FavGrove - Bookmark Manager`.
- Updated English and Chinese product copy, release metadata, promotional assets, and package naming for the FavGrove brand.
- Preserved browser storage contracts, import schemas, and the existing automatic-scan alarm identifier for upgrade compatibility.

- Worker-based duplicate bookmark, duplicate folder, empty-folder, and link scanning.

### Security And Reliability

- No analytics, telemetry, cloud sync, or bookmark upload.
- Optional host permission is requested only for link checking.
- HTTPS checks run through the background service worker.
- Plain HTTP and browser-store URLs are reserved for manual verification.
- Cloudflare challenges, authentication failures, rate limiting, proxy failures, and timeouts are not treated as confirmed broken links.

### Known Limitations

- This release is a beta and is not a browser-store stable release.
- Chinese and English localization coverage is not yet complete.
- Import currently supports HTML only.
- Empty-folder cleanup, persisted backup retention behavior, pinyin search, and several dashboard/manager refinements remain on the roadmap.
