> [!IMPORTANT]
> `v0.2.0` is the FavGrove beta candidate. It is not yet a Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons stable release. The published `v0.1.0` release remains available under the former Markora name.

## Why FavGrove

Browser bookmark managers become difficult to use once a collection grows into the thousands. FavGrove opens as a full-screen extension workspace and keeps bookmark processing on the user's device.

- Handles large bookmark collections with a virtualized manager list.
- Detects exact duplicate URLs, duplicate folders, empty folders, and link issues.
- Separates confirmed broken links from links blocked by networks, proxies, Cloudflare, or browser-protected stores.
- Creates local backups before destructive operations.
- Does not include analytics, telemetry, cloud sync, a developer-operated AI proxy, or automatic bookmark uploads.

## Current Features

| Area | Available in `v0.2.0 Beta` |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | Bookmark and folder statistics, quick actions, local recommendations, search history, recent activity |
| Search | Title, URL, folder-path, full-pinyin, and pinyin-initial search with 300 ms debounce and `Ctrl/Cmd+K` |
| Scanner | Duplicate bookmarks, duplicate folders, individual and batch empty-folder cleanup, broken-link review |
| Link review | HTTP error classification, network/proxy distinction, pagination, edit/open/delete actions |
| Manager | Folder filtering, collapsible tree, virtualized list, rename, move, reorder, tags, batch edit, batch delete, undo |
| Import | HTML, JSON, CSV, TXT, and OPML with preview, conflict handling, and backup |
| Export | HTML, JSON, CSV, TXT, and OPML |
| Settings | Theme, language, scanner, cache, automatic scan, backup retention, and non-destructive missing-bookmark recovery |
| Updates | Browser-managed Chrome/Edge store updates with an in-app reload notice when a new version is ready |
| AI analysis | Disabled by default; whole-library or folder analysis through a user-provided compatible endpoint, request preview, URL redaction, cancellation, and read-only structured results |
| Privacy | Local storage by default; no analytics, telemetry, shared AI key, developer-controlled bookmark server, or AI proxy |

The remaining roadmap is tracked in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) and [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md). Known gaps include final visible browser click-through checks, live-provider compatibility testing with user-owned credentials, store portal submission, and later automatic recommendation work. Full destructive replacement restore is documented as deferred.

## Link Scanner

FavGrove uses a Web Worker for scheduling, URL deduplication, concurrency, and progress calculation. HTTPS requests are sent through the Manifest V3 background service worker using optional host permission.

- Failed `HEAD` checks are verified with `GET`.
- Authentication, rate limiting, Cloudflare challenges, and network failures are not automatically treated as broken links.
- Plain HTTP and browser-store links are marked for manual verification to avoid browser security and CORS errors.
- The scanner uses the browser or system proxy configuration; FavGrove does not operate a remote scanning proxy.

## Installation

### Beta Release

1. After the beta is published, download `favgrove-v0.2.0.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/everett7623/FavGrove/releases).
2. Extract the ZIP to a permanent local folder.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the extracted folder.

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/everett7623/FavGrove.git
cd FavGrove
npm install
npm run build:extension
```

In Chrome or Edge, select **Load unpacked** and choose the generated `dist/` directory:

```text
D:\EvenFrank\Workspace\Plugins\Google\FavGrove\dist
```

Do **not** choose the project root (`FavGrove/`) or `.crx-dev/`. The root contains source files, while `.crx-dev/` is development-server output. Only `dist/` is the validated unpacked extension.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npm run validate:extension
npm run package:release
```

The release package is generated at:

```text
release/favgrove-v0.2.0.zip
```

## Quality

The `v0.2.0` beta candidate currently passes:

- ESLint with zero errors and zero warnings.
- TypeScript strict type checking.
- 97 Vitest unit and component tests.
- 11 Playwright end-to-end flows.
- Production extension validation.
- Permission audit for the release manifest and privacy copy.
- Chrome and Edge headless `dist/` load checks.
- Release ZIP packaging.

## Browser Support

| Browser | Status |
|---|---|
| Google Chrome 120+ | Supported |
| Microsoft Edge 120+ | Supported |
| Firefox | Not currently supported |

## Privacy

FavGrove does not collect personal data or operate a bookmark/AI proxy service. Settings, tags, history, scan caches, and backups remain in browser extension storage. Optional AI analysis is disabled by default and sends only previewed, minimized metadata to the user-selected endpoint after confirmation. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for permission and network details.
