## Summary

FavGrove v0.2.0 is the rebranded beta of the local-first Manifest V3 bookmark workspace for Chrome and Edge. The product was previously released as Markora v0.1.0; bookmark data, settings, backups, and import formats remain compatible.

## Highlights

- New FavGrove product name and refreshed English and Chinese release copy.
- Full-screen options-page workspace for Chrome and Edge.
- Dashboard statistics, quick actions, recent activity, and local cleanup recommendations.
- Duplicate bookmark, duplicate folder, empty-folder, and broken-link scanning.
- Link issue review with manual verification states, per-link rechecks, ignored-link management, and backup-protected deletion.
- Virtualized bookmark manager with rename, move, reorder, tags, batch tag editing, batch delete, and undo.
- HTML, JSON, CSV, TXT, and OPML import/export with preview and conflict handling.
- Local backups, restore, backup retention, theme, language, and automatic daily structure scan settings.

## Privacy

FavGrove stores bookmark metadata, settings, scan cache, search history, tags, and backups locally in browser extension storage. It does not include analytics, telemetry, account sync, cloud processing, or developer-operated bookmark uploads.

## License

FavGrove v0.2.0 is distributed under `GPL-3.0-or-later`. The release archive includes the matching license text, and the corresponding source is available from the tagged repository version. Previously distributed versions retain their existing license grants.
